## Introduction

Dynamic Programming (DP) is usually used to solve optimization problems. The only way to get better at DP is to practice. It takes some amount of practice to be able to recognize that a problem can be solved by DP.

## Techniques

Sometimes you do not need to store the whole DP table in memory, the last two values or the last two rows of the matrix will suffice.
